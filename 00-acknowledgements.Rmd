There are so many people that I want to thank for supporting and encouraging me throughout my PhD.
First, Claire and Oliver. 
Thank you for all the thought and time you have given me, as well as the space and encouragement to follow my own curiosity in my research.
You are both brilliant scientists and I have learned so much from working with you.
Second, thank you to Luke. 
I have really appreciated our in-depth conversations about my research, and all the advice you have given me about work and beyond.
Thank you all for being such kind and thoughtful supervisors throughout my PhD, especially given all the challenges of the last few years.
This PhD has allowed me to achieve so many things, and your confidence in me has made all the difference.

To Valerio and Al, I consider myself very lucky to have had you both as colleagues and friends. 
I have learned a huge amount from you both, which was helped by you always being such patient and enthusiastic teachers.
Thank you both.
Thanks also to Lizzy, Jacks, Benji, Chris and Jess for being the kind of colleagues that are a joy to get to work with. 
Having a warm group of PhD students to be part of made the whole process, and the move to Bristol, much easier, and I am so glad to know you all. 

Outside of work I have been very lucky to have friends and family who have supported me through all my ups and downs.
To Tiff, thanks for always being one message away, for chatting data with me and, of course, for moving to Bristol.
To my brother Luke, thanks for making me laugh and for providing late night maths support. 
I am very proud of you.
To Ben, you didn't hesitate to agree to move our lives across the country so I could do this. 
You've been there for me every day as sounding board, head technician and supporter.  
I am so grateful for you.
Lastly, to my Mum and Dad. 
From every school pick-up and drop-off, to proof reading this whole thesis, I cannot even begin to thank you for everything you have done that has enabled me to do this.
The determination you both have to work hard and achieve what you set your minds to has always inspired me to do the same, and played a big part in helping me to get this done.

Finally, my thanks must go to the participants and staff of ALSPAC. 
The data I have used in this thesis represents hundreds of hours of participant time that has been donated to science, which has made this research possible.
I am also very grateful to the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP who funded my PhD. It was supported by grant MR/N0137941/1 awarded to the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter from the Medical Research Council.
