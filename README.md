# Mental health data science in rich longitudinal cohort studies

This repository contains the code used to produce my thesis. 
[The final archived copy can be found here.](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/mental-health-data-science-in-rich-longitudinal-cohort-studies)

My thesis was written in R Markdown and exports to a PDF file that conforms to the University of Bristol's thesis requirements. 
It was produced using the [bristolthesis](https://github.com/mattlee821/bristolthesis) package written by Matthew Lee, which is a modified
version of [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown).

This repository contains all of the markdown code that my thesis is produced with. 
If the `data` folder is added to this repository then it is possible to reproduce all analyses, graphs and tables. 

Please feel free to get in touch with me via GitHub if you would like more information about applying 
to the [ALSPAC birth cohort study](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/) for this information.
